This is a very incomplete list of incomplete tasks for this project 
* Code hygiene
** Testing (test)
   - [ ] Create tests directory and add tests besides per-election smoketests
   - [ ] Move test_*.py to tests directory
   - [ ] Quicker/easier smoketests
** Build & Packaging (build)
   - [ ] Create src directory and move most code to this directory
   - [ ] Potentially add [tool.setuptools] include-package-data = true
   - [ ] whitelist conduits.py, abif_list.yml, examples.yml, static/* and templates/*
** Refactoring (refactor)
   - [ ] Move presentation logic from templates to Python
   - [ ] Replace print() statements with the standard `logging` module
   - [ ] Clean up Python imports
   - [ ] Generate IRV transfer indicators server-side, not JavaScript.
   - [ ] Unify color styling: Generate CSS classes in one place for use by all voting methods (FPTP, IRV, STAR, etc.)
   - [ ] Remove dynamic CSS generation from templates: Currently using <style> blocks in templates for candidate colors. Consider CSS custom properties, inline styles, or pre-generated classes instead.
   - [ ] Clean up data structure passed from abiflib to STAR template
   - [X] Percentages should be calculated by abiflib, not Jinja templates
* For 0.33.0
