# Vision for bifhub

After 0.33, bifhub is expected to be a primary focus, subject to planning and final prioritization.

## Overview

**bifhub** is envisioned as a dedicated component responsible for the discovery, cataloging, and management of ABIF (`.abif`) election data files. It will serve as a centralized "ballot box" or registry, providing a stable and queryable interface for other tools in the ecosystem, most notably `awt` (the web frontend) and `abiflib` (the core tallying library).

The primary goal of bifhub is to decouple the logic of *finding* and *managing* election data from the logic of *analyzing* and *displaying* it.

## Core Responsibilities

bifhub will consolidate and replace the functionality currently spread across two different components:

1.  **`fetchmgr.py` (from `abiftool`)**: bifhub will inherit the responsibility for fetching, downloading, and caching remote `.abif` files.
2.  **Catalog functions (from `awt`)**: bifhub will manage the metadata, tags, and local file paths currently handled by functions like `abif_catalog_init`, `build_election_list`, and `get_fileentries_by_tag` in `awt.py`.

Its core features will include:

*   **Unified Catalog**: Providing a single source of truth for all known elections, whether local or remote.
*   **Metadata Management**: Storing and serving metadata associated with each election (e.g., name, date, jurisdiction, tags).
*   **Queryable Interface**: Allowing client applications like `awt` to query for elections based on tags, IDs, or other metadata.
*   **Local Caching**: Intelligently caching remote files to ensure fast and reliable access.

## Architectural Role

bifhub will sit between the raw data sources (web servers, local files) and the applications that consume that data.

```
+-----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+
|  Remote .abif   |      |                |      |                 |
|      files      +------>      bifhub      <------>       awt       |
+-----------------+      |                |      |  (Web Frontend) |
                       | (The Catalog)  |      +-----------------+
+-----------------+      |                |
|   Local .abif   |      |                |      +-----------------+
|      files      +------>                <------>     abiflib     |
+-----------------+      +----------------+      | (Tally Library) |
                                                 +-----------------+
```

By creating this clear separation, `awt` can focus entirely on being a web frontend, and `abiflib` can focus on pure tallying logic, while bifhub handles the data logistics.

## Interfaces (planned)

Client applications (like `awt`) are expected to rely on a simple, stable query surface:
- By ID: fetch a specific electionâ€™s metadata and paths
- By tag: list/filter elections and provide tag counts
- By metadata: filter by year, jurisdiction, office, and provenance
- Featured sets: expose curated or recently updated elections

## Implementation Path

The bifhub functionality will initially be implemented as `src/bifhub.py` within the `awt` project during the refactoring process described in `refactor.md`. This allows the catalog management logic to be properly separated and tested before eventual extraction into a standalone service.

## Provenance and Source URLs (important)

As part of bifhub migration, ensure that most (ideally all) generated `.abif` files include a `metadata.source_url` indicating the exact URL used to fetch the raw container or file. This should be populated by the fetch/conversion layer (e.g., from `url`/`urls` in fetchspecs). This improves traceability and auditability, and will help downstream tools present reliable provenance to users.
